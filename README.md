# Mini Task 1: Build & Explain a Simple Blockchain

## 1. Blockchain Basics

**Definition**  
A blockchain is a distributed, tamper-evident ledger that records transactions in a series of linked blocks. Each block contains a list of data entries, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming an immutable chain. Because every participant holds a copy of the ledger and consensus rules govern how new blocks are added, no single entity can alter past entries without detection. This decentralization and cryptographic linking ensure data integrity, transparency, and security, making blockchain ideal for trustless environments where participants do not necessarily know or trust one another.

**Real-Life Use Cases**  
- **Supply Chain Management**: Track goods from origin to destination, ensuring provenance, authenticity, and reducing fraud.  
- **Digital Identity**: Provide self-sovereign identities where individuals control personal data and share verifiable credentials without a centralized authority.

## 2. Block Anatomy

+--------------------------------------------------+
|                    Block Header                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Previous Hash:  a3f4d1…7bcd                       |
| Merkle Root:    9f2a8b…4cde                       |
| Timestamp:      2025-06-08 04:00:00              |
| Nonce:          285940                             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                     Data                         |
| - TX1: Alice → Bob: 5 BTC                        |
| - TX2: Carol → Dave: 2 BTC                       |
| - …                                              |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Merkle Root & Data Integrity**  
The Merkle root is the top hash of a binary Merkle tree built from all transaction hashes in the block. To verify that a transaction (e.g., TX2) is included, one only needs TX2’s hash plus the sibling hashes along its branch. By recomputing and comparing the resulting root to the block header’s Merkle root, any tampering with TX2 or its neighbors is instantly detected without downloading every transaction.

## 3. Consensus Conceptualization

### 3.1 Proof of Work (PoW)  
Proof of Work requires miners to solve a computationally difficult puzzle—finding a nonce that produces a block hash below a target. This process demands significant electricity and processing power because miners try trillions of nonce values per second until one succeeds. The first miner to find a valid solution broadcasts the block, and the network verifies the hash. The high energy cost secures the network by making attacks economically unfeasible: to alter history, an attacker must redo the PoW for every subsequent block faster than honest miners. PoW thus balances block issuance with security but raises environmental concerns due to its resource intensity.

### 3.2 Proof of Stake (PoS)  
Proof of Stake replaces energy-intensive mining with a selection process based on token holdings (“stake”). Validators lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral; the protocol pseudo-randomly chooses one to propose the next block, often weighted by stake size and age. Because no brute-force hashing is required, PoS consumes far less energy than PoW. Misbehavior (e.g., proposing invalid blocks) incurs financial penalties: a validator’s deposited stake can be partially or fully “slashed.” This economic deterrent and staked collateral align validators’ incentives with network security and honesty.

### 3.3 Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)  
Delegated Proof of Stake introduces a governance layer where token holders vote for a limited set of “delegates” or “witnesses” who produce and validate blocks on their behalf. Voting power is proportional to the amount of stake delegated, encouraging active participation and accountability. These elected delegates take turns producing blocks in predefined rounds, achieving high throughput and low confirmation times. If a delegate acts maliciously or underperforms, voters can quickly revoke their support and elect a replacement. DPoS thus combines representative democracy with staking to balance performance, security, and decentralization.
