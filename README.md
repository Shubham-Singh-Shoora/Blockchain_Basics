| **Blockchain Name**         | Solana                                      | Hyperledger Fabric                                   | Quorum                                            |
| **Type**                    | Public                                      | Private                                              | Consortium                                        |
| **Consensus Mechanism**     | Proof of History (PoH) & Proof of Stake (PoS) | Pluggable (Raft, Kafka - older versions)             | Raft-based, IBFT (Istanbul BFT), QBFT             |
| **Permission Model**        | Open (Permissionless)                       | Permissioned                                         | Permissioned                                      |
| **Speed / Throughput (TPS)**| ~1,000-65,000 TPS (theoretical max higher)  | Varies by configuration (can reach 1,000s TPS, e.g. ~3,500 TPS reported in some tests, potentially up to 20,000 TPS) | Can reach 100s to a few 1000s TPS (e.g. >150 TPS with Raft, higher with IBFT/QBFT) |
| **Smart Contract Support**  | Y (Rust, C, C++)                            | Y (Chaincode in Go, Java, Node.js)                   | Y (Solidity)                                      |
| **Token Support**           | Native (SOL) and non-native tokens (SPL)    | Yes (Chaincode can manage custom tokens, FabToken was a concept) | Native (Ether, but typically not for value transfer in private settings) and non-native tokens |
| **Typical Use Case**        | DeFi, NFTs, Web3 Gaming, High-frequency trading | Supply chain management, Digital identity, Healthcare, Trade finance | Financial services, Inter-bank settlements, Supply chain, Enterprise solutions requiring privacy |
| **Notable Technical Feature**| Proof of History for high throughput, Sealevel (parallel smart contract runtime), Low transaction fees | Modular architecture, Pluggable consensus, Channels for data partitioning, Private data collections | Private transactions (using Tessera/Constellation), Enhanced data privacy, Ethereum compatibility, Pluggable consensus |
